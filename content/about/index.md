### A Bit About Me:

I work as the Lead Scientist for the Cities program with <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/new-york/" target="_About">The Nature Conservancy in New York</a>. In this role I use GIS, Remote Sensing, and statistical tools to characterize dynamics of open space, primarily in New York City. In this work, I look to understand where green space and open space are in various forms (e.g., the urban forest, green roofs), how it is changing through time, who benefits and does not benefit from these resources, and how to maintain and increase them. This work is all done through multiple lenses including equity, climate resiliency, and biodiversity conservation. I grew up in Staten Island, NY, and have been working for The Nature Conservancy in NY since 2015. It is a delight and a privilege to be working on these issues in my home city.

Prior to my current position I workd as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Tulsa, with <a href="http://ronbonett.weebly.com/" target="_About">Dr. Ron Bonett</a> as part of the NSF-Funded <a href="http://www.okepscor.org/" target="_About">Oklahoma EPSCoR program</a>. There I taught courses on <a href="http://mltconsecol.github.io/TU_LandscapeAnalysis_Documents" target="_About"> spatial analysis </a>, conducted research on environmental drivers of alternative life histories in salamanders, and worked on preparing Oklahoma LiDAR data for use by other researchers in the state.

I completed my PhD at Texas A&amp;M University in the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences.  My general research interests are in the fields of landscape ecology and conservation biology, with an emphasis on amphibians and reptiles. My dissertation research focused on understanding how anthropogenic landscape alterations impact amphibians indirectly, through large-scale processes. I conducted this work as part of the <a href="http://biodiversity.tamu.edu" target="_About">Applied Biodiversity Sciences IGERT program</a> (NSF-Funded) at Texas A&M.
